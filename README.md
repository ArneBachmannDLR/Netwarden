## Introduction

In today's world of increasing cyber threats, monitoring network traffic and identifying malicious activities are essential for maintaining a secure environment. This **Network Traffic Monitoring and Threat Detection Tool** provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing live network traffic and detecting anomalies, such as:

- DNS tunneling
- ARP spoofing
- IP/MAC spoofing
- SYN scans
- Suspicious DNS queries and unusual patterns

The tool integrates packet capture using `pyshark` and vulnerability scanning using `nmap`. It is designed for system administrators, network engineers, and cybersecurity professionals who need an efficient way to monitor and protect their networks.

---

## Features

### Key Highlights
- **Real-Time Packet Capture**:
  Monitor live traffic on any network interface, with analysis performed in real-time.
  
- **Advanced Threat Detection**:
  Detects:
  - DNS tunneling
  - ARP spoofing
  - SYN scans
  - Unusual network traffic patterns
  - Suspicious DNS queries

- **Nmap Integration**:
  Automatically scans flagged IP addresses to identify open ports and services for further investigation.

- **Comprehensive Logging**:
  Generates detailed logs of detected threats and Nmap results for auditing and reporting.

- **Customizable Rules**:
  Easily modify detection rules to tailor the tool for specific environments or requirements.

### Why Use This Tool?
- **Lightweight**: No heavy dependencies or complex configurations required.
- **Modular Design**: Extend functionality or integrate with existing tools with minimal effort.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides detailed threat descriptions for quick decision-making.

---

## How It Works

1. **Packet Capture**: 
   Traffic is captured using `pyshark.LiveCapture` on a specified interface.
   
2. **Packet Analysis**:
   Each packet is analyzed using detection algorithms to identify suspicious activity.

3. **Threat Detection**:
   - Detects DNS tunneling by monitoring query lengths and frequency.
   - Identifies ARP spoofing by checking IP/MAC mappings.
   - Flags SYN scans and other anomalies in TCP traffic.
   - Tracks unusual internal traffic patterns.

4. **Nmap Scanning**:
   Suspicious source IPs are scanned for open ports and services using Nmap.

5. **Logging and Reporting**:
   All findings are saved to `suspicious_activity.log` for future reference.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x**:
   Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
   
2. **Wireshark/tshark**:
   Install Wireshark and ensure the `tshark` command-line tool is in your PATH.

3. **Nmap**:
   Install Nmap for scanning suspicious IPs.

4. **Python Libraries**:
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pyshark python-nmap
   ```

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/network-analysis.git
   cd network-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python network_analysis.py
   ```

---

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Script

To start monitoring traffic:
```bash
python network_analysis.py
```

### Configuration Options

1. **Set the Network Interface**:
   Modify the interface in the script:
   ```python
   capture = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='Wi-Fi')
   ```

2. **Adjust Detection Thresholds**:
   Update thresholds in functions such as `detect_dns_tunneling` or `detect_arp_spoofing` for your environment.

## Detailed Functionality

### Threat Detection Algorithms

#### 1. DNS Tunneling Detection
- **What It Does**:
  - Identifies unusually long DNS queries (>225 characters).
  - Tracks high-frequency DNS requests (>50 requests per IP).
- **Why**: DNS tunneling is often used to exfiltrate data or establish malicious communication channels.

#### 2. ARP Spoofing Detection
- **What It Does**:
  - Monitors IP/MAC mappings for inconsistencies.
- **Why**: ARP spoofing allows attackers to intercept or redirect network traffic.

#### 3. SYN Scan Detection
- **What It Does**:
  - Flags packets with `SYN` flags (e.g., reconnaissance scans).
- **Why**: SYN scans are a common precursor to attacks.

#### 4. IP/MAC Spoofing Detection
- **What It Does**:
  - Flags mismatches between observed and expected IP/MAC mappings.
- **Why**: Spoofing can be used to impersonate trusted devices.

### Packet Analysis Workflow
1. Capture packets from the interface.
2. Analyze each packet based on predefined detection rules.
3. Log all suspicious activities and flag suspicious IPs for further scanning.

## Example Outputs

### Terminal Output
```plaintext
Suspicious activity detected:
- DNS Tunneling: Potential DNS tunneling detected: maliciousquery.example.com
- ARP Spoofing: IP 192.168.1.2 seen with MAC aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff, expected ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa
- SYN Scan: From 192.168.1.5

Performing Nmap scan on 192.168.1.5...
```

### Log File Example (`suspicious_activity.log`)
```plaintext
DNS Tunneling: Potential DNS tunneling detected: maliciousquery.example.com
ARP Spoofing: IP 192.168.1.2 seen with MAC aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff, expected ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa
SYN Scan: From 192.168.1.5

Nmap Scan Results:
192.168.1.5:
  Ports:
    22 (SSH): Open
    80 (HTTP): Open
```

## Potential Use Cases

1. **Enterprise Security**:
   Monitor corporate networks for threats like ARP spoofing or DNS tunneling.
2. **Incident Response**:
   Use logs and Nmap scans for post-incident analysis.
3. **Educational Tool**:
   Demonstrate packet analysis and threat detection techniques.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Encrypted Traffic**:
  Cannot analyze encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS).
- **False Positives**:
  May flag benign activity as suspicious in certain environments.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Issues**:
   Run with administrative privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo python network_analysis.py
   ```

2. **`tshark` Not Found**:
   Ensure Wireshark is installed and `tshark` is in your PATH.

3. **Nmap Errors**:
   Verify Nmap is installed and accessible.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **HTTPS Decryption**:
   Add support for analyzing encrypted traffic.
2. **Machine Learning**:
   Integrate anomaly detection models.
3. **Web Dashboard**:
   Build a real-time web interface for visualization.
